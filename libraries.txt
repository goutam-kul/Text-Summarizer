notebook:

Phe Jupyter Notebook library provides tools for creating and sharing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text in interactive documents.
boto3:

Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2.
mypy-boto3-s3:

A plugin for MyPy that provides type hints for working with the S3 (Simple Storage Service) service using Boto3.
python-box==6.0.2:

Python-box is a simple Python library for working with dictionaries and objects, making it easier to access and modify nested structures.
ensure==1.0.2:

Ensure is a library for asserting conditions in Python code, providing a simple way to check assumptions and raise informative errors if conditions are not met.
fastapi==0.78.0:

FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
uvicorn==0.18.3:
