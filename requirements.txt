#Explanation for the libraries: 

#datasets: A library for working with various datasets, providing a unified interface to access and manipulate data.


# rouge_score: A library for computing ROUGE scores, commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) to evaluate the quality of text summarization.

# py7zr: A Python library for working with 7z archives, providing compression and decompression functionalities.

# pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library, widely used for handling structured data in tabular form.

# nltk: The Natural Language Toolkit, a library for working with human language data. It provides tools for tasks like tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and more.

# tqdm: A simple and extensible library for creating progress bars, making it easy to visualize the progress of loops or tasks.

# pyYAML: A YAML parser and emitter library for Python, allowing you to work with YAML files for configuration or data serialization.

# matplotlib: A popular plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

# torch: PyTorch, an open-source machine learning library used for building and training neural networks.

# notebook: It seems like this could refer to Jupyter Notebooks, an interactive computing environment widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and more.

# boto3: The Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows you to interact with AWS services, such as S3, EC2, and more.

# mypy-boto3-s3: A library for type checking AWS S3 operations using the mypy static type checker in Python.

# python-box: A library for working with nested dictionaries in a convenient and Pythonic way.

# ensure: It seems like there might be a typo. If you meant pytest instead of ensure, it's a testing framework for Python.

# fastapi: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python, designed to be easy to use and performant.

# uvicorn: A lightweight ASGI server that serves FastAPI applications. It's used for running and deploying FastAPI web applications.

# jinja2: A template engine for Python, used for generating dynamic HTML or other markup language documents.
